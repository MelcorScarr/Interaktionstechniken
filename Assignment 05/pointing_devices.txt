a) Which advantages do direct pointing devices have over indirect pointing devices? Name one use case where using a direct
pointing device would not make any sense.
Direct pointing devices generally need less mental work to be used, since there is no "intermediate" calculation required to transform the actions into actual output.
However, there are often cases where direct pointing devices are not advisable. For example, work that needs to be highly precise, like a drone defusing a bomb or a mechanical helper in a surgery for a doctor, indirect input is preferable, since it allows for a device setting with higher precision.

b) How would you characterize “Shift” based on the classification criteria mentioned in the Wikipedia article?
A classification is not too easy. Let's go through the Wiki article classification step by step:

 * direct vs. indirect input
Shift is direct input as long as occlusion does not make the target ambiguous; once it is, the offset caused by the "scoping in" causes it to be indirect.

 * absolute vs. relative movement
Shift is always absolute, as in the distance moved in any case always is directly translatable into the output space.

 * isotonic vs. elastic vs. isometric
As is, Shift is a isotonic input method only, as it calculates distances. In theory, being based on a touch screen, it could also be used for isometric input, though this is not mentioned in the paper.

 * position control vs. rate control
Shift is a position control based input method, since the speed with which it is used has no effect.

 * translation vs. rotation
While touch screens nowadays offer rotation as input, this is not used in the case of shift. Translating (moving) the finger (the input device) is the primary method, however.

 * degrees of freedom
As used in the paper, Shift has two degrees of freedom (x and y axis)

 * possible states
Shift actually has two possible states: Occlusion and no occlusion, where the former will make a magnifying glass appear.

c) What is the size of the display used in the study?
The question of the size of the display is best answered by simply quoting the relating sentence in the paper:
"The experiment was conducted on the IPAQ PDA described above. It has a 550 × 730mm, 240 × 320px, display produc-ing an effective resolution of 0.436px/mm." (Daniel Vogel, Patrick Baudisch, CHI 2007 Proceedings • Mobile Interaction Techniques I, p. 663)
